		<h3>A true <span class="highlight">gearhead</span>, professional and physically speaking.</h3>
		<p>Since you're here you already know I'm a web designer. I specialize in Wordpress, and have designed and implemented responsive sites for a <a href="#portfolio" class="scrolly" title="Online Marketing Clients of Justin Chick">host of clients</a>. And then there are the things you might not know. I'm an avid cyclists, finding it the preferred way to travel to gain an intimate look at my surroundings. Same with my love for alternative transit. I buy local as much as I can, and have a particular passion for the local farmers markets that keep my vegetarian diet abundantly fresh. I'm dedicated to living life well; that dedication also translates to a successful collaboration with each and every client.</p>
