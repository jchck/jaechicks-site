		<h3>Developed to <span class="highlight">meet your needs</span>. And definitely <span class="highlight">out of the box</span>.</h3>
		<p>We meet. We talk. And beyond that, I gain insight into your organization, your audience, and your message. This is my favorite part: I engage your vision and find the best way to develop it ...for you, for your target market. My specialty is Wordpress. And since it's fully customizable, easily updated and thoroughly robust for many different executions, I will be able to create an experience for your audience that sets you in a well-designated class all your own.</p>
